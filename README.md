# One minute elections
The One Minute Elections project aims to eradicate the common excuse of insufficient time as a barrier to being informed about elections and political parties.

The idea is to provide a very brief description of the parties participating in the election for individuals not interested in political life. With the use of our app and an innovative way of presenting information, you can gain a basic understanding of each party's views within seconds. Our goal is to increase the number of young people participating in elections by moving them from the non-voting group to the voting group with a basic understanding.

## Installation
